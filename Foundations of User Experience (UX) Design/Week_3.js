//Five phases of design sprints
/*
    - Understand - getting clear picture for the challenge
    - Ideate - generating ideas
    - Decide - selecting the best ideas
    - Prototype - creating a prototype
    - Test - testing the prototype
*/

//Benefits of design sprints
/*
    - It's all about the user
    - Value every person in the room
    - The best ideas rise to the top
    - Time to focus
    - Lowers risks
    - Versatile scheduling

//Design sprint retrospectives
/*
    - Retrospective
*/

//Common retrospective questions
/*
    - During a design sprint, the focus is on: 
    - Understanding the design challenge 
    - Ideating solutions 
    - Deciding which solutions to build 
    - Prototyping a few solutions 
    - Testing those prototypes
*/
//What went well?
/*
    - Which tools saved you the most time and effort?
    - When did you feel the most satisfaction?
    - What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?
*/
//What can be improved?
/*
    - Questions you might ask during this part of the retrospective include:
    - What went wrong that caught you off guard?
    - Which problems came up the most often?
    - When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?
    - Then, examine the sprint’s outcome or final product, and ask questions like: 
    - Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design? 
    - Did an external factor derail your productivity? 
    - And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem? 

    - Groupthink
*/
//Lesson learned
/*
    - Questions you might ask include:
    - What did you discover during the sprint that you’re still wondering about?
    - How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?
*/
//Takeaway
/*
    Remember: Speak up and share your suggestions for how the next design sprint could be better. 
    Don’t be afraid to suggest anything you think will improve the project or next sprint. The 
    only bad suggestion is the one not shared!
