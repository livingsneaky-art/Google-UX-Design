//Understand design ideation

    Ideation
        - The process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic, with no attempt to judge
            or evaluate them
    
    Ideation in the real world
        - Brainstorm out loud
        - Document all ideas
        - Focus on quantity
        - Do not allow evaluation
        - Gather a diverse team
        - Question the obvious
        - Evaluate the ideas
             - Feasible: Tehnically possible to build
             - Desirable: Best at solving the user problem
             - Viable: Financially beneficial for the business

    Preparing for ideation
        - Empathize with your user
        - Define the problem
        - Establish a creative environment
        - Set a time limit
        - Assemble a diverse team
        - Think outside the box

//Explore lots of ideas

    Problem
        - Olivia is a parent who needs a way to ride her bike with her 2-year-old Luca because
            he can't ride his own bike.

    Why should we come up with a lot of ideas?
        - List of ideas is narrowed based on constraints
        - Need to focus on equity
        - Let users test the ideas
*/

//Recognize business needs during design ideation
/*
    Branding
        - Two major components of branding are voice and tone.

    Design can help facilitate a converstation between a business and its users.

//Self-Reflection: Ideation in everyday life
/*
    Question 1
    Describe an example of a time you used the ideation process in the real world. If you can’t think of an example, 
    think of a project where the ideation process could have been useful. Reflect on the steps you took. How did the 
    process benefit the projects you worked on? What were the drawbacks?

    - As a software developer, I used the ideation process to brainstorm new features for a web application. I gathered a 
    team, defined objectives, generated ideas, and evaluated and refined them based on feasibility, impact, and user needs. 
    We tested the top ideas with users and improved our concepts further. The ideation process helped us prioritize the most 
    impactful ideas and refine them to create a more user-friendly and effective web application. The ideation process can 
    be time-consuming and lead to many unfeasible ideas. However, by using a structured approach, we were able to focus on 
    the most impactful ideas and overcome these potential drawbacks.

    Competitive audits can offer many benefits throughout your ideation phase, including:
        - Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs. 
        - Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs. 
        - Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
        - Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
        - Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors.
