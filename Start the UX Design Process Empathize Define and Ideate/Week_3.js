    Problem statement
        - A clear description of the user's need that should be addressed

        - Human-centered
        - Broad enought for creative freedom
        - Narrow enough to be solved by a design

    *username* is a *user characteristics*
    who needs *user need*
    because *insight*.

    Example:
    Amail is a athelete
    who needs to sign up for workout classes
    because the class he wants to participate in fills up fast.

    Problem statement
        - Establish goals
        - Understand constraints
        - Define deliverables
        - Create benchmarks for success

//Define problem statements

    You learned earlier that there are four categories pain points can fall into: 
    - Financial, or money-related pain points. 
    - Product, which are pain points related to quality issues. 
    - Process, which are pain points related to the user’s journey. 
    - Support, which are pain points related to getting help from customer service.

    The 5 Ws and H: who, what, when, where, why, and how
    The most common framework used to create problem statements is the 5 Ws and H framework. 
    After you define the user’s pain points, you can answer who, what, when, where, why, and 
        how to solve the user’s problem.

        - Who is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.
        - What are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.
        - Where is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.
        - When does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings. 
        - Why is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.
        - How are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

    Hypothesis statement
        - Our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be

    If *action*
    then *outcome*

    First, you can use the if / then format to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of if/then hypothesis statements applied to the users of the dog walker app:
    - If Arnold downloads the dog walker app, then they can utilize the “simplified” mode setting to view only the basic app functions. 
    - If Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, then they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.
    Second, you can use the we believe format to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of we believe hypothesis statements applied to the dog walker app:
    - We believe that a simplified mode of the dog walker app for Arnold will allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.
    - We believe that easy access to available dog walkers for Tobias will increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets.
