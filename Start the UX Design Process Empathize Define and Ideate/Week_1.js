    Best practices for giving peer review feedback
    - Understand the activity
    - Provide descriptive feedback
    - Pick two or three things you liked about their work
    - Pick two or three things that can be improved with actionable advice
    - Be respectful and kind

//Empathize with users
/*
    - Empathy

    UX design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved.
    It's about solving problems that users actually want solved.
*/

//Understand empathy in UX design
/*
    How to empathize with users
    - Ask lots of questions
    - Become more observant
    - Be an active listener
    - Request input
    - Have an open mind
    - Keep current on UX research
    
    Empathy vs sympathy
    Empathy is sometimes confused with sympathy, but the two terms don't mean the same thing. Empathy means 
    understanding someone's feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself. Sympathy is the experience
    of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves.

//Activity: Define your research goals and questions

//Activity Exemplar: Define your research goals and questions
/*
    Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations 
    for the previous activity. This exemplar was completed for a food delivery app called Zia's Pizza. 

    Interview goals: 
        I want to understand common challenges people face trying to manage a busy schedule and meal planning.
        I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of ordering from a restaurant.  

    Interview questions: 
        Can you describe your current schedule and how you balance your responsibilities with meal planning?
        How often do you order meals from a restaurant? When you do, what is your motivation for doing so? 
        What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How does this make you feel?
        Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved?

    Target participant characteristics:
        Ages 18-62
        Lives in metropolitan or suburban areas
        People who order food from restaurants at least once a week
        Include participants of different genders
