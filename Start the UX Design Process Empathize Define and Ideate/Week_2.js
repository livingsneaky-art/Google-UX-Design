/*
    User story = a short, simple description of a software feature told from the perspective of the 
                 person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
    Advantages of user stories:
        - Prioritize design goals
        - Unite the team
        - Inspire empathetic design decisions
        - Personalize pitches to stakeholders

    User story format:
        As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
