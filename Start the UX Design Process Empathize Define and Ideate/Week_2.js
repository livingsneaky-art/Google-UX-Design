//Craft user stories
/*
    User story = a short, simple description of a software feature told from the perspective of the 
                 person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
    Advantages of user stories:
        - Prioritize design goals
        - Unite the team
        - Inspire empathetic design decisions
        - Personalize pitches to stakeholders

    User story format:
        As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]

//Consider edge cases
/*
    Happy path
        - A user story with a happy ending
    
    Edge case 
        - A rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience

    Spotting & resolving edge cases
        - Create a personas and user stories
        - Thoroughhly review the project before launch
        - Use wireframes

//Create user journey map
/*
    User journey
        - The series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal

    Benefits of user journey mapping
        - Helps UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users
        - Reduces impact of designer bias
        - Highlights new pain points
        - Idenfities improvement opportunities

    Accessibility
        Touch
           - Permanent
                - One arm
           - Temporary
                - Arm injury
           - Situational   
                - New parent 
           Touch: How would you design for users who have use of one arm, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?
                - Decide where to place buttons within your design based on several different hand sizes.
                - Create a feature that allows double taps to avoid accidental icon clicks.
                - Enable the one-handed keyboard feature and general keyboard compatibility.
                - Allow button customization for easy access to information that the user finds most important.

            See: How would you design for users who have limited vision, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?
                - Use a larger font to create a reader-friendly design of the app.
                - Ensure the app and the images have alternate text that can be read by a screen reader.
                - Detect whether the user is operating a motor vehicle.
                - Design the app with high contrast colors.
                - Don’t rely on text color to explain navigation or next steps. For example, don’t use red text alone as an indicator of a warning. Instead, your design should include explicit instructions.

            Hear: How would you design for users who have limited hearing, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 
                - Don’t rely solely on sounds to provide app updates, like a new message notification. Instead, enable haptics, which are vibrations that engage a user’s sense of touch, and notification lights.
                - Apply closed captioning to all videos. 
                - Provide a text messaging system within the app to allow users to communicate through writing.

            Speak: How would you design for users who cannot speak, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 
                - Provide written intros, descriptions, and instructions for users, in addition to video-based content.
                - Provide Real-Time Texting during phone calls with users or with app support.
                - Arrange alternatives for automated systems that rely on speech recognition.
                - Provide an in-app messaging system that allows the use of emojis and image uploads.
